# Tailwind Getting Started
Tailwind CSS is a design system implementation in pure CSS. It is also configurable. It gives developers super powers. It allows them to build websites with a clean consistent UI out of the box.


## How to use
Modify the `index.html` and `input.css` (with tailwind syntax), automatically will be generated an `output.css` that is used in the `index.html` page.
* `make install`: install tailwind
* `make watch`: start by compiling `input.css` in `output.css`
* `make run`: start the live serve, perform changes in `input.css` and automatically will be rendered in `output.css`.
